# Command-Line Library Management System

This is a simple command-line library management system implemented in C++. It allows librarians or users to manage library resources, including adding and removing books, checking book availability, and displaying the library's catalog.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Add new books to the library catalog, providing details such as title, author, and ISBN.

- **Remove Books:** Remove books from the catalog based on criteria like title or ISBN.

- **Book Availability:** Check the availability of a book by its title or ISBN. Update the availability status when a book is borrowed or returned.

- **Display Catalog:** View the library's catalog, including book details and availability status.
